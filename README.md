# Weather App - VanillaJS (API Based)
This is a fully responsive Weather App project built completely in Vanilla Javascript along with HTML and CSS.
I have used OpenWeather API for fetching the current weather data.
One can simply enter the location name to fetch the current weather data
of that location.
